# Day and Night

The game, Day and Night, is a zombie-survival third-person shooter. As a fan of Resident Evil(Biohazard) Serires, I've been always wanted
to create a game that has the same chilling and intense atmosphere. This game is my first attempt and also the very first game-dev project on Unity3D. My original plan was to make the game look like RE2, but due to the fact that I am not capable of 3D modeling, I had to improvise with the free and purchasable assets online.

Below are footages of the various aspects of the game in the current status. I tried to make the game intuitive and require no trick controls. I will upload the playable demo once I complete the first level. Currently only the mechanics of the game is available.

## Zombies

They are 4 of the 15+ zombies models that I have acquired (either purchased or free-to-use copyrighted).

Due to Mecanim system in Unity3D, I used any humanoid animations that I could acquire online (mostly from Unity Asset Store and Mixamo.com)
